## The Gap
1. Traditionally environmental data are presented directly to business stakeholders and they have to then interpret the data in the context of their business operations to distill out decisions.
2. This can be very difficult to do since the translation between environmental factors and business metrics can be very complex.
Let us look at a couple of examples of this gap between environmental science and business operations:

### Storm management in power utilities

### Irrigation in agriculture

## The Opportunity
Across industry segments, there is a convergence of business data availabilty, cloud computing, IoT and analytics (machine learning, optimization, etc.)
This convergence is creating an opportunity to bridge the above gap and create tremendous value on multiple fronts:
1. For businesses by helping them optimize their operations and planning more precisely for reduces costs and increased revenue.
2. For societies by mitigating the adverse impacts and maximizing the positive impacts of environmental phenomena.
3. For the environmental science community by opening the funnel of potential careers and areas of research beyond traditional problems to these new areas of applied science.
4. For investors in environmental science by increasing the penetration and value generation from their investments.

### Bridging the gap in utility storm management

### Bridging the gap in irrigation advisory

## How do we build these bridges?
If we step back and look at the common elements of building these bridges in different industries, we these four pillars that hold up these bridges:
1. Data
2. Knowledge
3. Science and models
4. People and organizations
